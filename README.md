# macOS Scientific Calculator Clone

This project is a web-based clone of the macOS Scientific Calculator, built with React and Tailwind CSS. It includes functionalities for basic calculations, scientific calculations, memory functions, and more, with a user interface similar to the macOS calculator.

## Features

- **Basic Calculations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
- **Scientific Calculations:** Trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentiation, roots, and more.
- **Memory Functions:** Memory clear (MC), memory recall (MR), memory add (M+), and memory subtract (M-).
- **Constants and Random Numbers:** π, e, and random number generation.
- **Mode Switching:** Radians and degrees for trigonometric calculations.
- **History:** View past calculations.
- **Theme Switching:** Toggle between light and dark modes.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nandinis1024/confetti-calculator-todayPay.git
   cd macOS-scientific-calculator

Install dependencies:
bash
npm install
Run the project:

bash
npm run dev
Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:5173

Usage
Once the project is running, you can use the calculator for various types of calculations:

Basic Calculations
Use the numeric buttons (0-9) and the basic operation buttons (+, -, *, /) for standard arithmetic operations.
Press the = button to evaluate the expression.
Scientific Calculations
Use the scientific buttons for advanced calculations, such as:
sin, cos, tan for trigonometric functions.
log, ln for logarithmic calculations.
x^2, x^3, x^y for exponentiation.
sqrt, cbrt for root calculations.
1/x for reciprocal.
x! for factorial.
Memory Functions
MC to clear the memory.
MR to recall the value stored in memory.
M+ to add the current value to memory.
M- to subtract the current value from memory.
Constants and Random Numbers
Use the π and e buttons to insert these constants into your calculation.
Use the Rand button to generate a random number between 0 and 1.
Mode Switching
Use the Rad button to toggle between radians and degrees for trigonometric calculations.
